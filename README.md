# hi

here i'll be putting all of my custom scratch extensions <br>
here's a rundown of each extension:

## DumbUtils

DumbUtils is a ~~useless~~ miscellaneous extension which has a few blocks that ~~may or may not be implemented in a much better way in other extensions~~ serve each of their own purpose.

## BTHYCT (Block That Helps You Censor Things)

Contains a single block that can censor things. very self explanatory.
